🧶 Strikkewis – A New Way to Knit

Welcome to Strikkewis, a modern web app that transforms the knitting pattern experience for both designers and knitters.
This project is currently in active development as a Minimum Lovable Product (MLP)!

🚀 What is Strikkewis?

Strikkewis is a digital tool where:

Designers can create dynamic, interactive knitting patterns tailored to different sizes, gauges, and yarns.

Knitters can follow their own customized step-by-step patterns with progress tracking and technique videos.

No more confusing PDFs! Everything is streamlined and user-friendly.

✨ Core Features (in development)

    🔒 Magic link for distribution of knitting patterns from anywhere

    🧶 Pattern creation tools for designers (steps, stitch counts per size, yarn suggestions)

    📈 Progress tracking for knitters across multiple projects

    📦 Image uploads for patterns

    🎯 Dynamic pattern adjustment based on user(knitter) inputs (size, gauge, yarn)

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React (Vite), TypeScript

Backend: Supabase (Database + Authentication + Storage)

Auth: Magic link authentication with email verification

Hosting: (TBD after MVP)

🧪 Local Development
Clone the project:

git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/strikkewis-app.git

- Stripe subscription integration (later)
- RLS (Row Level Security) setup for production
- Deployment to live environment (planned)
